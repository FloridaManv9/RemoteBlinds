This project is currently in-progress, with effort focusing on design for the universal controller to be retrofitted on most window blinds.
After this, other long term goals are aimed at the solar energy source in addition to the phone application for control and timings to be set for the blinds.

A video can be found here which shows the current status of the device: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpF1AzxmgLQ

I will be uploading the 3D-models as well as the Python scripts and dependencies shortly.
